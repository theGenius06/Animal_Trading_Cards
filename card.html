		<p>The black panther is not a separate species but rather a melanistic (dark-colored) variant of several species of large cats, primarily leopards (Panthera pardus) in Asia and Africa and jaguars (Panthera onca) in the Americas. The term "black panther" refers to these animals' dark, almost black, fur, which is caused by a genetic mutation that results in an excess of dark pigmentation. Black panthers are known for their stealth and power, making them apex predators in their respective habitats.</p>
